# Chetak Line Follower Robot üöÄ
A high-performance line follower robot designed for speed and precision, featuring advanced PID control for smooth navigation, dynamic obstacle avoidance, and modular hardware design.

## Features:
  1. Adaptive Path Following: Utilizes custom PID algorithms for precise line tracking, even on sharp curves and intersections.
  2. Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance: Equipped with ultrasonic sensors to detect and navigate around obstacles without deviating from the track.
  3. Custom IR Sensor Array: Built and calibrated a 5-sensor array for optimal line detection and responsiveness.
  4. Compact Modular Design: Laser-cut acrylic housing for efficient assembly and enhanced sensor alignment.
  5. Intersection Handling: Optimized logic for detecting and passing intersections seamlessly.
